        Put one course code per line, you may or may not need the semester suffix
        after the code. So try both <code>SENG365</code> and <code>SENG365S1</code>.

      <p>Many hours of potential study time were wasted making this as useful as possible to students.
      If you appreciate what Learn Enhancer does, share it with your friends and classmates.</p>
      <p>Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/agronauts">Patrick Nicholls</a> for implementing the auto-login
      and preferences screen.</p>
