# Learn Enhancer

Learn Enhancer improves the experience of using the University of Canterbury Moodle server (aka _Learn_) by forcing PDFs to preview in full screen rather than inside an iFrame, applying a mild re-skinning to remove some redundant UI and set some gentler colours for links and the navigation bar, and adding an automatic login.
